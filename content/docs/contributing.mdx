We're building Utterance in the open, and contributions are welcome.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nizh0/Utterance.git
cd Utterance
npm install
npm run start
```

## Development Workflow

`npm run start` runs the Next.js dev server with Fumadocs, the SDK build watcher, and tests in parallel. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.

### Individual Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Next.js dev server |
| `npm run build:sdk` | Build SDK (ESM + CJS + types) |
| `npm run build:sdk:watch` | Rebuild SDK on file changes |
| `npm run test` | Run unit tests |
| `npm run test:watch` | Re-run tests on file changes |
| `npm run lint` | Check code style |
| `npm run typecheck` | Check TypeScript types |

## Areas We Need Help

**ML & Audio (high priority)**
- Collecting and labeling training data
- Building the feature extraction pipeline (MFCCs, pitch, energy, speech rate)
- Experimenting with model architectures (transformer, LSTM, CNN+GRU)
- Exporting and quantizing to ONNX

**JavaScript / TypeScript**
- ONNX Runtime Web integration
- React hooks package (`@utterance/react`)
- React Native support (`@utterance/react-native`)

**Documentation**
- Integration guides
- Tutorials and blog posts

**Testing**
- Real-world conversation testing
- Edge cases (background noise, multiple speakers, accents)
