# Utterance

Every voice app faces the same problem: **it can't tell when you're done talking.**

You pause to think, and it cuts you off. You take a breath, and it responds too soon. You want to interrupt, and it keeps going.

Current solutions either detect silence (Silero VAD, ricky0123/vad) without understanding intent, or use server-side AI (OpenAI Realtime, AssemblyAI) that adds latency and costs.

**Utterance is different.** It uses a lightweight ML model entirely on the client side. It recognizes the difference between a thinking pause and a completed turn. No cloud. No delay. No per-minute fees.

## Key Features

- **Semantic endpointing** — understands thinking pauses vs. turn completion
- **Interrupt detection** — knows when a user wants to interject
- **Confidence scoring** — returns probability (0–1) for each detection
- **Client-side only** — no cloud, no latency, no API costs
- **Lightweight** — model under 5MB, inference under 50ms
- **Framework agnostic** — works with any voice stack
- **Privacy first** — audio never leaves the device
