## Installation

```bash
npm install @utterance/core
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { Utterance } from "@utterance/core";

const detector = new Utterance();

detector.on("turnEnd", (result) => {
  console.log("User is done speaking", result.confidence);
  // Safe to send to your AI / LLM now
});

detector.on("pause", (result) => {
  console.log("User is thinking...", result.duration);
  // Don't interrupt — they're still going
});

detector.on("interrupt", () => {
  console.log("User wants to speak — stop AI response");
  // Halt TTS playback, yield the floor
});

detector.on("speechStart", () => {
  console.log("User started speaking");
});

// Start listening
await detector.start();

// Stop when done
detector.stop();
```

That's it. Utterance handles the microphone, feature extraction, and classification automatically. You just listen for events.
